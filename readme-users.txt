README -- Instructions for Backsmash
Backsmash is a simple multiplayer game where players compete to be the first to reach a point goal. A point value will be displayed in the middle of the screen during the game. The point count starts at 0 and increases at an exponential speed. Players can hit their assigned key to get all of the points displayed. When a player presses their key to get the points, the point count resets to 0 and starts the increasing process again. The game can be customized to change most settings in the game to change how it plays and the strategies players can use to win.
